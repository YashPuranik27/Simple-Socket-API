# Simple-Socket-API

The purpose of this project is to give me an idea on how socket programming works. This is a simple project where I create a server socket and client that communicated with each other and can send data. In this project, the client sends data to the server and the server outputs two files. In one output file (outr-proj.txt), it reverses the string being sent while maintaining the order of the lines being sent. In the other output file (outup-proj.txt), it makes every character in the string uppercase.
